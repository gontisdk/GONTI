# ❌ No macOS Support

The **GONTI** engine does **not support macOS** for several critical reasons, both technical and organizational.

---

## 🛑 Technical & Legal Constraints

- **Legal testing on macOS requires owning official Apple hardware**, which significantly increases the cost of development.
- This project is maintained on a **zero-budget basis** — the only development expense is electricity. Therefore, purchasing Apple hardware is not a viable option.
- **Illegal testing methods** (such as Hackintosh or pirated environments) are strictly against the project's philosophy and cannot ensure compatibility or stability.

---

## 👤 Single-Developer Project

The entire engine is **designed, developed, and maintained by one person**, responsible for:

- Performance and optimization,
- Code structure and organization,
- Documentation and examples,
- Unit and integration testing,
- And all other areas of development.

## 🔄 API Instability on macOS

Apple's API is known for **frequent and unpredictable changes**. Supporting macOS would require:

- **Rapid code updates** whenever Apple changes something (even minor),
- **Maintaining backward compatibility** across older macOS versions,
- Which is simply **not feasible** for a solo developer without funding.

---

## 📌 Summary

Due to the reasons outlined above, **macOS is not and will not be supported**, unless:

- Apple changes its developer policy and allows proper testing on non-Apple machines,
- Or the project receives independent funding to purchase and maintain macOS development hardware.
