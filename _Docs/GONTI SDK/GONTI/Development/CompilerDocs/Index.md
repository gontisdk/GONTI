# ðŸ”§ Compiler & Toolchain Overview

This section covers the **compiler** and **toolchain** used to build and analyze the GONTI engine.

You'll find:
- Why LLVM Clang was chosen as the primary compiler,
- Which compilers are officially supported or partially compatible,
- What LLVM-based tools are used in development and diagnostics.

> ðŸ§± Note: This is **not** the build system section.  
> Scripts and build process details are located in `Docs/Build/`.
